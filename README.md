## **Product Overview**

**Anamnesis** is a user-sovereignty-first vault for **accounts** and **permanent files**.  
Inspired by Plato’s “anamnesis” (recollection), it helps you preserve what matters—securely, privately, and for the long term.

**Live**: https://ranuts.github.io/anamnesis/

## **What you can do**

- **Manage multi-chain accounts**: keep your wallets organized in one place (e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Sui, Arweave).
- **Store files for the long term**: choose between **public permanent storage** or **private sealed storage**.
- **Keep a clear history**: view and manage your uploads and related records from a single dashboard.
- **Retrieve anytime**: download and decrypt your private files when you need them.

## **Privacy & Safety principles**

- **Your data stays yours**: sensitive information is protected locally; Anamnesis does not collect it.
- **No tracking mindset**: designed to avoid centralized custody and minimize trust assumptions.
- **Re-auth for sensitive actions**: extra confirmation before revealing highly sensitive information.

## **Use cases**

- **Personal archive**: receipts, certificates, photos, important documents.
- **Creator proofs**: publish and timestamp work for long-term reference.
- **Team handover**: preserve critical files with controlled access and later retrieval.

## **Open Source**
